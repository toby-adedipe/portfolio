  "description": "Production-ready, low-latency speech translation app enabling real-time English <-> Mandarin conversations. The system streams microphone audio to a custom WebSocket server, performs live transcription with interim results, translates in context, and synthesizes speech back to the user.\n\n**Key Technical Achievements:**\n- Bidirectional audio streaming with a custom Node.js WebSocket server\n- Deepgram Nova-3 streaming transcription at 16kHz linear16 with endpointing\n- Automatic language detection per utterance (English/Mandarin)\n- GPT-4o-mini translation with streaming UI updates\n- Sequential TTS playback queue to prevent overlap\n\n**Performance:**\n- End-to-end response under 2s in typical conversations\n- Chunked audio processing and buffering for low latency\n\n**Frontend Architecture:**\n- React hooks for streaming pipeline, transcription, audio capture, and voice detection\n- Real-time UI state machine (idle -> listening -> translating -> speaking)\n- Progressive transcript and translation rendering\n\n**Backend Integration:**\n- WebSocket proxy for audio streaming\n- Multiple concurrent API connections (Deepgram + OpenAI)\n- Robust error handling and connection lifecycle management",
